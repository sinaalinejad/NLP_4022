  " Based on the recommended advice and your query about the difference between a cold and allergies, here is a helpful response:\n\nAllergic Rhinitis, commonly known as allergies, and a cold are both respiratory conditions that can cause similar symptoms such as a runny nose, sneezing, and congestion. However, there are key differences between the two.\n\nAllergic Rhinitis is a reaction to allergens like pollen, dust, or pet dander.
