## Using LLMs for Query Paraphrasing or Similar Questions Identification (HW7.ipynb)
In this notebook, I have done multiple experiments using different LLMs.  
The experimented LLMs are: PersianLlama and PersianMind. For each of them, Zero-Shot, One-Shot, and Few-Shot learning is conducted.  
As these are models with lots of parameters, I had to use Quantization as a technique to load heavy models.
